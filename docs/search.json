I am interested in quantitative marine research including fisheries, ecosystem based mangement, and anthropogenic effects on marine ecoysystems research. I have a broad range of experiences in education, research, and policy work spanning both coasts of the United States, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and in remote and urban settings. I enjoy projects that couple science with outreach and community engagement."
