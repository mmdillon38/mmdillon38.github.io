This is a one-year NSF-funded position conducting research on the effect of ocean acidification and predator presence on Boring Sponges (Cliona celata) and (Cliona californiana). In January 2025 the lab’s microCT was installed and we are in the process of developing SOPs to utilize it in our research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does temperature and salinity affect the metabolic processes of an invasive species?\nBlue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) are an introduced species in the Chesapeake Bay. As a technician at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences in the Fabrizio Lab, I ran temperature and salinity metabolic rate experiments on blue catfish to aid managers in forecasting future range expansion for blue catfish.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does ocean warming affect the early life stages of fish?\nIn the summer of 2018, I interned at the NOAA JJ Howard Marine Lab in Sandy Hook, New Jersey.
